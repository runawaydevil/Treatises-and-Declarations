Hello Pablo,

Name: The Great Stoat Revolution
Description: "The stoat's voracity and efficiency as a predator of small mammals drew human attention to other possible uses, and it was introduced to New Zealand to control rabbit populations that were damaging native ecosystems. Unfortunately, the idea was a disaster: instead of hunting rabbits, stoats preferred attacking the nests of native birds such as the kakapo and kiwi, which had no experience against such attacks, generating a violent struggle for life among the Small."
Motto: Stoats are cool.
