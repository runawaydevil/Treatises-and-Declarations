Hello Pablo,

The case is famous of the man who, in 1963, tried to transport a gorilla from Idlewild Airport (NY) to O'Hare (Chicago). After dressing the gorilla in youthful clothes and passing the first two checkpoints, the gorilla was exposed while boarding the turboprop plane.

All the best,
Marcos Barbxxara
