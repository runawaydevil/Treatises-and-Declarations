Hello Pablo,

Around noon, there was a knock at the door from that Ivo who saw the grape — or maybe that was his name and I didn't hear it well — and he seemed much older than I expected, which suggests he has already seen every kind of grape in the world and now only has the famous Bulgarian grapes left to know. He told me, and proved it with documents, that he is a direct descendant of the Hindu sage who invented zero, a circumstance that guarantees him and his family a royalty on every zero used in the world until the end of time. He also took the opportunity to discreetly collect what I owed him.

Best,
Marcos Barbxxara
