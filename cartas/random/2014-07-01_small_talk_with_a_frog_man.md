Hello Pablo,

How to start a conversation with a frog-man:

"It is believed that the first ethnic group to migrate to the low Ayeyarwady valley were the Mons, dominant in the south around 900 BC; they were among the first in Southeast Asia to adopt Theravada Buddhism. In the 1st century BC, the Pyu followed, a Tibeto-Burman-speaking people who founded several city-states in central Ayeyarwady. The Pyu kingdom was destroyed in the 9th century by the kingdom of Nanchao."
"Sorry?"
"I saw it on Zorra Total."

Best,
Marcos Barbxxara
