Hello Pablo,

Review — Le Domaine de Chateauvieux Restaurant

In 2002, chef Guy Savoneux established himself as a goldsmith of cuisine, never lacking originality. His flamboyant dish in Astdrès sauce was seductive and minimalist; it carried the palate to the flowered meadow of Troyes, transmitting the savoir-faire of classic chefs.

But the cote d'or ended tragically. Last Tuesday we tried Savoneux's papaya lamb at Le Domaine de Chateauvieux Restaurant. The lamb turned out to be a foolish, sad food.

Le Domaine de Chateauvieux Restaurant
16 Avenue Bugeaud II, Bersiller
Accepts meal vouchers (VR and Ticket Restaurante).

Regards,
Marcos Barbxxara
