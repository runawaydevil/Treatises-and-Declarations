Hello Pablo,

776 BC.

At the ancient Olympic Games, a spectator comments:

"The athletes have already started! Achilles, the favorite, has taken the lead, but... wait a second! He seems to take an eternity to run the first meter, as if movement were somehow impossible!"

Zeno muses: "I can't believe I bought a ticket for this."

Best,
Marcos Barbxxara
