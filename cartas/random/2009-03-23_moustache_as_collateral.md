Hello Pablo,

It is said that Dom Joao de Castro, a Portuguese general in Goa, once found himself short of money, cut off one of his moustaches, and sent it to request a loan of twenty thousand dobroes as collateral. The money arrived immediately, and when the term was up he paid the debt and reclaimed the pledged hair.

Take care,
Marcos Barbxxara
